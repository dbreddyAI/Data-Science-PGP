<h1 align="center"> Graph Generator </h1>
## Introduction
  In this project we aim at making the generation of graphs for EDA easier in two different ways.
1. Is through the function where a user can pass in the data set and specify the location for the generated graphs to be stored
2. Is through the GUI (Graphical User Interface) where user can easily select the file and location for storage and our function will automatically generate and store graphs for both Categorical and Numerical Variables
